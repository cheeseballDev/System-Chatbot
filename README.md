## Chatbot System 
This is a collaborative work alongside with Adidoodoo, Jcb-1ee, and rnldlcn.

A chatbot system made using Java that uses keys, sets, and arrays for chatbot responses.
It uses all OOP principles taught in STI (except for method overloading cause we didn't find it applicable in this project).

Special thanks to Earlson Pasco, our IT instructor for the OOP subject.
